## Game Design Project 1
 # Guidelines
Project #1. [Due: September 20th] Requirements
If you have completed the Clock, you may start to work on the design of our first 3D game project. Here are the detailed requirements:

1)      In this game, there should be an earth, a tree, a Pokémon (or some of your favorite animal or cartoon character), a starry sky, the moon and the stars in the sky.

2)      The stars and the moon in the sky should rotate. Some of the stars should rotate around the moon, and the moon should rotate around the earth. Some of the stars should spin, but not too fast.

3)      The Pokémon can be controlled by the player to move up, down, fly, jump, run around.

4)      When the game starts, the Pokémon should sit under the tree.

5)      The tree leaves should move with the mild wind.

6)      The player should be able to make the Pokémon jump and bounce, and to land on the moon. In the process, the Pokémon shall avoid the collision with any of the stars.
 
You may use any of the free assets from the asset store. Also game sound, background music and user friendly UI are required.
 
In the next a few days, we will introduce the knowledge and methods that can be used to complete this project. However, if you would like to start early, feel free to do some research on your own! You may work individually or with ONE partner.
